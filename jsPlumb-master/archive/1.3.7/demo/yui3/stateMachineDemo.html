            <p>This is a demonstration of the StateMachine connector type, and of 'Continuous' anchors, which are anchors whose location is calculated based
                on the location of all other connected elements.
            </p>
            <p>These behave in a similar way to 'Dynamic' anchors, which have been in jsPlumb for a while now,
                but Continuous anchors do not require a list of possible locations, and they guarantee that every Connection has its own anchor.
            </p>
            <p>Click and drag new Connections from the red div in each element; the main elements in the UI are configured to be Connection targets. You can
            drag from one of these divs onto its parent element to create a 'loopback' connection.</p>
            <p>Click on a Connection to delete it.</p>
            <p>makeSource is used in a special way in this demonstration: it is provided with a 'parent' parameter, which tells jsPlumb which element should
            be the eventual source of a newly created connection.  So although you drag from the red divs, the connection sources are always configured to be the
            main divs in the UI.</p>

	    	<p>This demonstration uses jsPlumb 1.3.7 and YUI 3.3.0.</p>
