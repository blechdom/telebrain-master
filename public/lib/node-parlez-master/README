node-parlez

a unofficial api for Google's Text-To-Speech service(translate.google.com) written using node.js. It operates as an intermediary server between their system and your web app, providing the produced translations in MP3 format.

Required:
Node-Paperboy 


Very basic breakdown of steps.

1.Your webapp makes a request to a server running this js file, like http://speak.com/q=Bonjour&tl=fr
q being the phrase
tl being the target language.

2.Node grabs the mp3 file of the result, and returns back the file name(generated by timestamp) to your web app.

3.You can they play back this file with html5 audio like <audio src="http://speak.com/files/$FILENAME">
Files are served back to the enduser with Paperboy.

I have tested this in a EC2 micro instance.
