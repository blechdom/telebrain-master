It is an **interactive object model** on top of canvas element. It is also an **SVG-to-canvas parser**.\n\n<a href=\"http://fabricjs.com/kitchensink/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js/raw/master/lib/screenshot.png\" style=\"width:300px;box-shadow:rgba(0,0,0,0.3) 0 0 5px\"></a>\n\nUsing Fabric.js, you can create and populate objects on canvas; objects like simple geometrical shapes — rectangles, circles, ellipses, polygons, or more complex shapes consisting of hundreds or thousands of simple paths. You can then scale, move, and rotate these objects with the mouse; modify their properties — color, transparency, z-index, etc. You can also manipulate these objects altogether — grouping them with a simple mouse selection.\n\n[Contributions](https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js/wiki/Love-Fabric%3F-Help-us-by...) are very much welcome!\n\n### Goals\n\n- Unit tested (1660+ tests at the moment)\n- Modular (~60 small \"classes\", modules, mixins)\n- Cross-browser\n- [Fast](https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js/wiki/Focus-on-speed)\n- Encapsulated in one object\n- No browser sniffing for critical functionality\n- Runs under ES5 strict mode\n- Runs on a server under [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n\n### Supported browsers\n\n- Firefox 2+\n- Safari 3+\n- Opera 9.64+\n- Chrome (all versions should work)\n- IE9+\n\n#### With help of [Explorer Canvas](http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/)\n\n- IE8 (incomplete — about 17 failing tests at the moment)\n- IE7,6 (incomplete - about 27 failing tests at the moment)\n\nSee [Fabric limitations in Old IE](https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js/wiki/Fabric-limitations-in-oldIE).\n\nYou can [run automated unit tests](http://fabricjs.com/test/unit/) right in the browser.\n\n### History\n\nFabric.js started as a foundation for design editor on [printio.ru](http://printio.ru) — interactive online store with ability to create your own designs. The idea was to create [Javascript-based editor](http://printio.ru/ringer_man_tees/new), which would make it easy to manipulate vector shapes and images on T-Shirts. Since performance was one of the most critical requirements, we chose canvas over SVG. While SVG is excellent with static shapes, it's not as performant as canvas when it comes to dynamic manipulation of objects (movement, scaling, rotation, etc.). Fabric.js was heavily inspired by [Ernest Delgado's canvas experiment](http://www.ernestdelgado.com/public-tests/canvasphoto/demo/canvas.html). In fact, code from Ernest's experiment was the foundation of an entire framework. Later, Fabric.js grew into a collection of distinct object types and got an SVG-to-canvas parser.\n\n<h3 id=\"fabric-building\">Building</h3>\n\n1. [Install Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation)\n\n2. Build distribution file  **[~76K minified, ~22K gzipped]**\n\n        $ node build.js\n\n    - Or build a custom distribution file, by passing (comma separated) module names to be included.\n\n            $ node build.js modules=text,serialization,parser\n            // or\n            $ node build.js modules=text\n            // or\n            $ node build.js modules=parser,text\n            // etc.\n\n      By default (when none of the modules are specified) only basic functionality is included.\n      See the list of modules below for more information on each one of them.\n      Note that default distribution has support for **static canvases** only.\n\n      To get minimal distribution with interactivity, make sure to include corresponding module:\n\n            $ node build.js modules=interaction\n\n    - You can also include all modules like so:\n\n            $ node build.js modules=ALL\n\n3. Create a minified distribution file\n\n        # Using YUICompressor (default option)\n        $ node build.js modules=... minifier=yui\n\n        # or Google Closure Compiler\n        $ node build.js modules=... minifier=closure\n\n### Demos\n\n- [Demos](http://fabricjs.com/demos/)\n- [Kitchensink demo](http://fabricjs.com/kitchensink/)\n- [Benchmarks](http://fabricjs.com/benchmarks/)\n\n### Documentation\n\nDocumentation is always available at [http://fabricjs.com/docs/](http://fabricjs.com/docs/).\n\nAlso see [official 4-part intro series](http://fabricjs.com/articles), [presentation from BK.js](http://www.slideshare.net/kangax/fabricjs-building-acanvaslibrarybk) and [presentation from Falsy Values](http://www.slideshare.net/kangax/fabric-falsy-values-8067834) for an overview of fabric.js, how it works, and its features.\n\n### Optional modules\n\nThese are the optional modules that could be specified for inclusion, when building custom version of fabric:\n\n- **text** — Adds support for `fabric.Text`\n- **serialization** — Adds support for `loadFromJSON`, `loadFromDatalessJSON`, and `clone` methods on `fabric.Canvas`\n- **interaction** — Adds support for interactive features of fabric — selecting/transforming objects/groups via mouse/touch devices.\n- **parser** — Adds support for `fabric.parseSVGDocument`, `fabric.loadSVGFromURL`, and `fabric.loadSVGFromString`\n- **image_filters** — Adds support for image filters, such as grayscale of white removal.\n- **easing** — Adds support for animation easing functions\n- **node** — Adds support for running fabric under node.js, with help of [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) and [node-canvas](https://github.com/learnboost/node-canvas) libraries.\n- **freedrawing** — Adds support for free drawing\n- **gestures** — Adds support for multitouch gestures with help of [Event.js](https://github.com/mudcube/Event.js)\n- **object_straightening** — Adds support for rotating an object to one of 0, 90, 180, 270, etc. depending on which is angle is closer.\n\nAdditional flags for build script are:\n\n- **no-strict** — Strips \"use strict\" directives from source\n- **no-svg-export** — Removes svg exporting functionality\n- **no-es5-compat** - Removes ES5 compat methods (Array.prototype.*, String.prototype.*, Function.prototype.*)\n\nFor example:\n\n    node build.js modules=ALL exclude=json no-strict no-svg-export\n\n### Examples of use\n\n#### Adding red rectangle to canvas\n\n    <canvas id=\"canvas\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"></canvas>\n    ...\n    var canvas = new fabric.Canvas('canvas');\n\n    var rect = new fabric.Rect({\n      top: 100,\n      left: 100,\n      width: 60,\n      height: 70,\n      fill: 'red'\n    });\n\n    canvas.add(rect);\n\n### Staying in touch\n\nFollow [@fabric.js](http://twitter.com/fabricjs) or [@kangax](http://twitter.com/kangax) on twitter.
